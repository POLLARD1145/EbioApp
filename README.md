# 🚀 Embedded Biometric Approval System with Decentralized Blockchain Security

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project aims to design and develop an **Embedded Biometric Approval System with Decentralized Blockchain Security**. The primary objective is to enhance security, transparency, and trust in systems that manage sensitive and critical transactions. The system integrates biometric authentication with blockchain technology to prevent fraud, unauthorized access, and data manipulation.

### 🔧 Key Technologies

- **ESP32**: Microcontroller used for embedding the system on a USB-like stick.
- **Fingerprint Sensor**: For biometric authentication.
- **Ethereum Smart Contracts**: Used as the blockchain technology for decentralized, immutable, and transparent transaction records.
- **Quorum-Based Approval**: Requiring at least two of three authorized individuals for critical transaction approvals.

## 🌐 Scenario: Remote High-Value Transaction Approval

### 🔑 Authentication Flow

1. **Initial Identity Verification**

   - Bank manager's identity pre-verified through:
     - Multi-factor authentication
     - Corporate identity management system
     - Secure VPN connection

2. **Physical Passkey Connection**

   - Manager connects blockchain-enabled biometric passkey to computer.
   - USB-like device with integrated:
     - Fingerprint sensor
     - ESP32 microcontroller
     - Secure element for cryptographic operations

3. **Biometric Authorization Process**

   ```
   User Identity Verification Sequence:
   1. Insert Passkey
   2. Scan Fingerprint
   3. Blockchain Smart Contract Validation
   4. Transaction Approval Trigger
   ```

4. **Smart Contract Verification**

```solidity
contract BankTransactionApproval {
    struct TransactionParameters {
        uint256 amount;
        address sender;
        address recipient;
        bool requireMultiSignature;
    }

    function approveTransaction(bytes32 biometricSignature, TransactionParameters memory tx) public returns (bool) {
        // Validate user authorization
        // Check transaction limits
        // Log blockchain transaction
        // Trigger bank system approval
    }
}
```

### 🛡️ Security Mechanisms

- **Multi-Layer Authentication**

  - Physical device possession
  - Biometric verification
  - Blockchain-based identity check
  - Transaction-specific authorization

- **Decentralized Verification**
  - No single point of failure
  - Immutable transaction logs
  - Real-time blockchain verification

---

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

- **Biometric Template**

  - Encrypted fingerprint template
  - Stored on private blockchain
  - Never transmitted as raw biometric data

- **Transaction Limits**
  - Configurable per user role
  - Automatic flagging of suspicious transactions
  - Tiered approval for different transaction values

### 📝 Workflow Example

1. Bank manager logs into secure system.
2. Initiates high-value transaction.
3. Connects biometric passkey.
4. Scans fingerprint.
5. Blockchain verifies identity and authorization.
6. Transaction approved and logged.

### ✅ Advantages

- Prevents unauthorized transactions.
- Provides irrefutable proof of authorization.
- Enables secure remote approvals.
- Protects against identity theft.
